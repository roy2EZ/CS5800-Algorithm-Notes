S = 1
dist = [0, inf, inf, inf]
i = 1, we get 2, 3, 4, 1, dist = [0, 3, inf, inf]
i = 2, we get 2, 3, 4, 1, dist = [0, 3, -7, 0]
i = 3, dist = [0, 3, -7, 0]

Since we can at least update one true shortest distance at each loop, then we need at most n-1 times to update all true shorteset distances. After that, the dist array shouldn't change. If it changes, it means there's a cycle with negative weights.
PseudoCOde
for (i = 1... n-1) {// we do the algo n-1 times
    for (u = 1...n) {
        for (V in G.neighbors(u)) {
            relax(u, v);
        }
    }
}
